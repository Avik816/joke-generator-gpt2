Q: There was a man in Bulgaria who drove a train for a living. There was a man in Bulgaria who drove a train for a living. He loved his job, driving a train had been his dream ever since he was a child. He loved to make the train go as fast as possible. Unfortunately, one day he was a little too reckless and caused a crash. He made it out, but a single person died. Well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident. He was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution. When the day of the execution came, he requested a single banana as his last meal. After eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was flown, sparks flew and smoke filled the air- but nothing happened. The man was perfectly fine. Well, at the time, there was an old Bulgarian law that said a failed execution was a sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free. And somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train. Having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon. Once again, he caused a train to crash, this time killing two people. The trial went much the same as the first, resulting in a sentence of execution. For his final meal, the man requested two bananas. After eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room- and the man was once again unharmed. Well, this of course meant that he was free to go. And once again, he somehow manages to get his old job back. To what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people. And so he once again found himself being sentenced to death. On the day of his execution, he requested his final meal- three bananas. You know what. No, said the executioner. I've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. I'm not giving you a thing to eat, we're strapping you in and doing this now. Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without a last meal. The switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room- and the man was still unharmed. The executioner was speechless. The man looked at the executioner and said Oh, the bananas had nothing to do with it A: I'm just a bad conductor <|endoftext|>

Q: Every time my dad tells this it gets just a little more elaborate. But this is how I remember it. Paul has a shitty life, his wife constantly berates him, his job sucks, his boss is a bully, his car is a shitty 85 ford pinto with a cracked windshield and is in bad need of a new transmission and to top it all off he's chubby, balding, and he has a small penis. The only thing good in Paul's life is his friend Artie. Artie isn't the brightest bulb in the world, but he's always been there for Paul in the tough times. On October 5, 1953 Artie stood up for Paul against his bully in 7th grade. Artie got his ass handed to him at that time, but so did Paul. That incident resulted in a life long friendship. Paul and Artie went to the same High School together. They traveled around Europe that one summer in college. Artie was Paul's best man at his wedding. Everyone thought speech Artie gave was terrible, But Paul loved it Artie was his best friend. Artie's life wasn't much better either, he never had the smarts for that great Job. In fact he was stuck in a dead end job as a construction labourer. Artie's car was pretty shitty too. Artie never married, but he was happy in the knowledge that at least he didn't end up with Paul's shitty wife. For Paul's 46th birthday Artie was pretty broke, so all he could get his friend was a single lottery ticket. Artie being the sentimental guy that he was picked the date of the start of their friendship, and their respective ages . Paul loved the present, and thought that the two of them should go to the Legion that friday to split a round of beers and listen to them call out the numbers. On Friday they are both sitting there at the Legion having a laugh over a couple of beers when the cute lottery girl comes on the t. to read out the numbers. Paul pulls out the ticket and spreads it out on the beer stained table in front of them. The lottery girl starts reading out the numbers, 45, 10, 05. Both of Paul and Artie's hearts start beating, thats 200$ already. 53, Holy crap thats like a 10, 000 ticket. They both start losing their shit. 46. Paul feints. He just won the jackpot. 37million dollars. Two minutes later Artie finally revives Paul. Paul and Artie celebrate the night away, buy round after round for the people at the Legion and get absolutely shittered. They close out the bar and as the ugly lights come on they stumble blitzed, singing, onto the street arm in arm with the winning lottery ticket in hand and start the long walk back to Paul's place. Halfway home, Paul comes to two drunken conclusions: 1. he has to share the winnings with his friend Artie 50/50, and 2. His bitch of a wife ain't gonna let that happen. Paul decides to share this epiphany with Artie and the two of them sit down to figure out this problem, and after about a half hour the only conclusion that they can come to is Paul's Wife has got to go. Artie being the good friend that he is tells Paul that he is willing to take care of the little problem himself, Artie never really liked Paul's wife anyway. But Artie being the legal genius that he is wants to have some assurance that Paul is still gonna follow through his side of the plan and wants a contract. Paul agrees and pulls out the only piece of paper in his wallet, a one dollar bill and Pays Artie to off his wife. And they come up with a plan. 40 min later the 2 of them drunkenly stumble through Paul's front door only to find Paul's wife up in the living room. She immediatly starts yelling WHERE THE FUCK HAVE YOU BEEN. WHY ARE YOU SO DRUNK. on and on she yells until finishes with WELL IF YOU TWO ARE SUCH GOOD BUDDYS THEN YOU CAN SLEEP TOGETHER FOR ALL I CARE. and slams the door to the bedroom. They both look at each other, smirk, then immediately pass out on the couches. The next day Paul awakes to find Artie gone, Artie knows better then to be found on the couch by Paul's wife in the morning. Paul wakes with the biggest hangover that he has EVER experienced, but Paul knows that this day is this is the first day of a new life for him. His wife of course is in her typical mood, but Paul placates her all day with yes, dear , Of course, Dear , I'll get right on it Dear. All the while feeling like crap. That evening Paul puts his plan into motion and he begs his wife to go to the Safeway to pick up some pain killers and pepto for his still lingering hangover. Because he has been soo compliant all day his wife reluctantly goes. Little does she know this is the last shopping trip she will ever make. Paul quickly texts Artie It's a go . While Paul's wife is shopping in the Safeway Artie sneaks into the back seat of Paul's wife's Car and waits for her. When paul's wife finally gets done with the shopping and gets out to the car, Artie pops up from the hiding place and grabs her around the neck and starts choking her to death. At one point Artie thinks to himself this is taking way longer then it does in the movies. All the while she is violently twitching and struggling in the front seat. Eventually she succumbs to the strength Artie built up over all those years of construction labour. Little does Artie know, but the store manager 35 year old Freddie has seen everything happen on the security cameras and has called the cops and ran outside to try to stop what Artie has done. Yet Freddie arrives just a little too late, in fact just as Artie is about to make his escape. Artie, realizing that he has been seen by this guy running towards the car knows that he has to do something to get away, so he sprints to Freddie and with one swing knocks him out. Artie then full of fear and panic gets on top of Freddie and chokes him to death as well. Unfortunately for Artie and Paul this gives the police time to arrive and Arrest him A: The next day the paper lands on Paul's doorstep with the headline Artie Chokes two for a dollar at Safeway <|endoftext|>

Q: This conversation between my (ex)gf. Long post is long: **Her:** Remember dad's tomato bushes. Well they're attacking. At least one is leaning across the path trying to get at my window. We had the war of the roses, now its time for the attack of the tomatoes. **Me:** I don't remember anything about tomato bushes. From one battle to the next. **Her:** Yep. Lookout tomatoes here comes the chutney recipe. **Me:** I can just imagine a cucumber campaign. Operation onion would be next, which will fail, causing everyone to cry. Dill Day follows, a great success for the allied gardeners. All too soon though, the kamikaze carrots set in, utterly ruining the radish raid. The mushroom maneuver is employed, saving the troops, allowing them to deal the final blow in the asparagus assault. **Her:** Don't forget the pumpkins want to supply ground cover with heavy support. **Me:** Ah yes, the pumpkin paratroopers. **Her:** Thyme is running out. **Me:** Prepare the beetroot bombs. **Her:** Aim for Potato Garden. **Me:** Fire the capsicum. Deploy the celery team. **Her:** Bring in the egg plant division to support the capsicum. **Me:** This is it boys, life or dirt. I want a passionfruit unit to find us a vantage point, and the strawberry unit to surround them. **Her:** We had better bring the lettuce up to date. **Me:** The cabbage are under withering fire, we need support from the raspberry division. The potatoes are mashed, so well need to send the zucchini in their place. **Her:** The zucchini can't take that heavy fire, they'll be grated. Send spinach for some extra iron. The sweet potatoes are digging in at the ridge. **Me:** Prepare the watermelon bomb, we need to finish this. The eggplant were squashed, deploy the broccoli brigade. The beans need to get out of there, or they'll be split. **Her:** Cauliflowers are going in to retrieve the beans. How brave to risk their florets. The corn commandos are deployed, but the artichokes are all out of heart, we need to boost morale. **Me:** The leeks are down. They'll be flattened if we don't do something. Are the spinach still operational. **Her:** Too bad the pepper isn't on our side, they're well seasoned troops. Spinach is a go. Nothing has touched it. **Me:** But wait. We still have the chillies to give them heavy fire. **Her:** And the squashes and peas. **Me:** The ginger is holding it's ground, but it's being cut down by the pineapple. The basil should make things interesting, send them to aid the potatoes. **Her:** The squashes might be able to pull a surprise attack if the peas act as a diversion. Basil is sent, the energy tomatoe is moving forward, good thing the potatoes are there otherwise its attack of the Italian. **Me:** The beans are all strung out, they need something to back them up. Sending the raspberries to replace the peas. **Her:** The turnips are pulling out to make room. **Me:** The avocados seem to be remarkably tough, let's send them in. **Her:** I'm all out of veggies. **Me:** Gather the troops and retreat. **Her:** The tomatoes have agreed to sign the Treaty of Vegi. The rhubarb will preside over the treaty signing. **Me:** Do we trust them to keep their end of the deal, or will they go soft under pressure. **Her:** The avocado's can keep an eye on them, their seeds are tough, A: **Me:** Righto, the mulberries are procuring the ink <|endoftext|>

" "Yeah, sure, what is it . " replied the man. "Daddy, how much money do you make an hour. " "That's none of your business. What makes you ask such a thing. " the man said angrily. "I just want to know. Please tell me, how much do you make an hour. " pleaded the little boy. "If you must know, I make $20. 00 an hour. " "Oh," the little boy replied, head bowed. Looking up, he said, "Daddy, may I borrow $9. 00 please. " The father was furious. "If the only reason you wanted to know how much money I make is just so you can borrow some to buy a silly toy or some other nonsense, then you march yourself straight to your room and go to bed. Think about why you're being so selfish. I work long, hard hours every day and don't have time for such childish games. " The little boy quietly went to his room and shut the door. The man sat down and started to get even madder about the little boy's questioning. How dare he ask such questions only to get some money. After an hour or so, the man had calmed down, and started to think he may have been a little hard on his son. May be there was something he really needed to buy with that $9. 00 and he really didn't ask for money very often. The man went to the door of the little boy's room and opened the door. "Are you asleep son. " he asked. "No daddy, I'm awake," replied the boy. "I've been thinking, maybe I was too hard on you earlier," said the man. "It's been long day and I took my aggravation out on you. Here's that $9. 00 you asked for. " The little boy sat straight up, beaming. "Oh, thank you daddy. " he yelled. Then, reaching under his pillow, he pulled out some more crumpled up bills. The man, seeing that the boy already had money, started to get angry again. The little boy slowly counted out his money, then looked up at the man. "Why did you want more money if you already had some. " the father grumbled. "Because I didn't have enough, but now I do," the little boy replied. "Daddy, I have $20. 00 now.

Q: How I quit my school newsreader job When I was in high school the media department got a few of us to do a weekly news update and I was co-anchor. On our last day of filming for the year we decided to go out for pizza and at the end of the night it was just me and Jessica, the main anchor on the show. I walked her home and just as we got to the bridge near her house I tripped on the uneven pavement and bumped her. She fell over the rail and hit her head on the large stones by the creek bank. I didn't know what to do and panicked. I felt that my whole life would be over if everyone found out that I killed Jessica. So, in that moment, I knew what I had to do. Nobody saw us leave together and no-one passed us on the road. I went down to where her warm lifeless body laid and dug a shallow grave. The ground was soft, so it was easy to make one big enough for Jessica's frail but broken body. She seemed so peaceful in that moment under the bridge and you could almost mistake her for being asleep under the warm sodium lights above. I tossed her in making sure that everything was covered and wouldn't be exposed any time soon. I took a nearby branch and used it to brush over my tracks and made my way back up to the road. I waited until there were no signs of anyone else and hurried back home making sure to discard my shoes in an industrial bin on the way. I made sure to leave behind anything with any possible traces of dirt or residue that forensics could possibly link back to me. After I had a shower, I cleared the fog on the glass and caught a glimpse of my reflection in the mirror. I was not the same person that I was a few hours ago and I knew that I could never be that person ever again. The days and weeks that followed were not easy for me. I could not feel any emotion at all: the closest thing being anger that I did not feel guilty at all. Not then anyway. It started with the nightmares where I would be under that bridge hearing Jessica calling out to me asking why - why. - until I would wake up in sweaty sheets gasping for breath. The nightmares got worse, but also the weight of it all. In the weeks that followed, the community rallied together and there were posters of Jessica's smiling face everywhere. I could not think about anything else and everything else didn't really matter. I made it through each day by playing a version of myself: like I was controlling some sort of puppet and going through the motions. The show continued, until one day - and I remember the moment. The emotion I had been suppressing all along could not be contained any more. We were filming, and it was maybe 3 or even 4 months since the night I did what I did. I was ready to do my segment on the upcoming home game when I saw something caught in the spiral of my notebook - it was a single strand of Jessica's hair. I could not speak and when I looked up everyone was staring at me and, at first, I didn't know why. I only realised that I was crying hysterically when I saw the monitor. I felt that black darkness that had enshrouded me for so long getting tighter, like a carpet snake trying to maintain its grip on prey, but I knew I had to tell everyone. I began speaking, describing the events that happened and the way her neck was bent all the way back and the way her body was still warm when I touched her. The way I brushed away her hair from her cheek when I held her. The way her skin looked under the warmth of sodium lights. I told everyone how I felt when I realised what I had done, and how I came to the decision I made that night. The snake slowly hissed, and I could feel its grip loosening its hold on me as I told her story. I felt, for the first time in a long time, that I could breathe. Breathe. In that instant I felt a release, a perverted type of redemption that at the very least allowed Jessica to have some sort of peace. I knew that I had to tell everyone about that night and what happened to her. If not for me then at least for her. I had to talk A: talk about burying the lead <|endoftext|>

Q: The Seattle Symphony is playing Beethoven's 9th. In the version they're doing, the bass section plays a bit at the start, then just sits there til the final part of the last movement. So, they decide to leave the concert and go out for drinks. While at the bar down the street, they meet a European nobleman, and they become good friends. Unfortunately, the guy had been gorging himself on crappy bar food, and he quickly falls into a food coma. One of the basses drunkenly checks his watch and says, crap. We're not going to get back on stage in time. As they're sprinting back, one of them says, actually, I thought this would happen, so I tied some of the pages of the conductor's score together - that way, he'll have to slow the tempo way down with his right hand while undoes the knots with his left. And so they get back just in time to finish the Symphony, and the audience is none the wiser. The conductor, however, was furious A: After all, they'd left him at the bottom of the 9th, with the score tied, while the basses loaded, and the Count was full <|endoftext|>

Q: Three moles lived outside of a pancake house One morning at approximately 7:30, the first mole awoke, usually the early riser of the three, he got ready, and in the midst of putting on his morning robe, could not resist the sudden urge to follow his twitching nose to the surface to smell the sticky sweet scent emulating from the restaurant not even 35 feet away. He poked his head halfway out his cozy mole-hole and was overwhelmed with joy. I can smell pancakes, syrup, hot coffee, and all sorts of incredible edibles in there During all of his commotion the second mole awoke, and sprung out of bed to see what all the excitement was about. Scrambling up the long winding tunnel to the big blue sky, he barely squeezed his way beside mole number one, desperate to see what was happening. Dazed and confused the third mole awoke, and stumbled to the entryway, following a confusing array of excited squeals, and shouts of pure joy. As he came closer, as he neared the bundle of fur these sounds were emulating from, he could clearly make out the sounds produced by the first two moles, he came closer, as close as possible until his little ears were pressed against the mole's feet near the stuffed entryway and listened. I can smell strawberry strudel No you can't, it's blueberry.

I'm sorry son, but we live in an apartment and just don't have the space , said Madi. The child was disappointed, and sulked away to his room. The next day, he talked to his best friend Max about it. Upon hearing about it, his friend snapped his fingers and said, Hey, I know what you can do. My dad has tons of space in our yard. I'm sure he'd let you make a garden there. And you live close by so you can check on it after school every day. And so the boy was allowed by his friend's father to start a garden. He took charge of all the aspects of the project; he insisted on the exact measurements and materials, and even that all the sides should be the same length. Like clockwork he visited it each day after school, watered the plants and picked any weeds. The garden was his pride and joy.

He knew as long as he was around he could prevent it, but he could not watch them the whole time they were there. He asked his dad, Please watch those two if they are in the back yard. I don't want them near my friend's garden. Max's father knew how much the garden meant to Madi's child, so he agreed. Well unfortunately there came a time where nobody was watching the twins. Max was upstairs doing homework, and his father was checking on dinner in the oven. Quickly realizing his mistake, he dashed to the screen door and saw the twins jumping around on the plants. He shouted to Max, MAX A: THE NEW YORK NICKS ARE PLAYING IN MADI'S SON'S SQUARE GARDEN <|endoftext|>

Q: Saw this online. Thought you would like it My grandfather or Pa, as I called him gave my an absolute gem. He was actually my step mother's dad and we already called my other grandfather Papa, so we called him 'Pa Ulb' - Ulb being his surname. He was an incredible artist and would paint awesome things for us or on our bedroom walls. I remember he painted me a massive Star Wars piece on one of my walls when Episode 1 came out. I was only about about 6 at the time and remember being scared of Darth Maul. From this we used to joke around that Darth Maul would come and get me if I did anything wrong. Sort of like a police officer watching my every move, to ensure I behaved. This carried on as a joke until he died 2 years ago, when I had done something wrong he said he'd call the police and get Maul to take me away. When he did die he had just finished an incredible painting of Darth Maul as a police officer. It was amazing. My parents could make sense of it and weren't sure if it was him that had painted it, so they flipped it over because he used to always write Pa Ulb Art and the title of the painting A: Surely enough on the back it said Pa ulb Art - Maul Cop <|endoftext|>

Q: The Laughing Hoagie Two high school students named Steve and Josh found themselves broke on a saturday afternoon while strolling around in the city mall. They hadn't eaten lunch and they were getting hungry, but alas, they had no money for food and they were hours away from home. I heard there's a place downtown where you can get a sandwich for free Steve said to Josh. That sounds great, let's check it out Josh replied, and they headed downtown. They soon found the place. It was a small shop, too small to feel like a real business. The place had no tables or chairs, and not really much furniture at all. An old man stood behind a small counter and eyed them as they entered. Welcome to the Laughing Hoagie he said. What is a laughing hoagie. Josh wondered. It's the name of this sandwich place. This is not a regular sandwich shop. We have a special offer here for people who can't afford to pay for their food. the man said as he smiled a toothy smile at them. So it's true then, Josh blurted out, we can get free food here. Not so fast. The old man said. There is a condition. What is it. Steve wondered aloud. Well, the man started you have to listen to one of my jokes, and the one of you who laughs the most genuine laugh gets a free sandwhich. The other one gets nothing. As he said this, the old man opened a small refrigerator that stood behind the counter and produced a large, footlong sandwhich with ham, cheese, bacon, lettuce and tomatoes. It was covered in a white dressing and gave off a faint peppery aroma. The boys' mouths started watering at the sight of it. What. So only one of us gets a sandwhich. Steve asked, taken aback. Those are the rules, the old man grinned, if you don't like it, you may leave. Nah, we'll hear the joke. Josh said. Steve looked at him, and then nodded to the old man. All right. the old man rubbed his hands together as if preparing to dig into a strenuous task. What did the mother Buffalo say when her boy left for college. he asked, and looked expectantly at the teens. They both stared at him with blank expressions. Bye Son. he exclaimed, and struggled not to burst out giggling at his own quip. Josh chuckled a bit, but Steve just frowned.

He goes down to the opera house on the day of the audition, only to find he's come down with a sore throat and can't hit his notes anymore. In a panic, he asks one of the directors if they can postpone his audition. I'm sorry, says the director, but we can't delay an audition for just one performer. That would set a bad precedent.

We've found it helps soothe the throat better than any other fish we've tried. Sure enough the man is able to sing again. He hits all his notes and gives an exemplary performance.

I'm sorry, said the director, you performed well, but we've decided to give the part to someone else A: That's OK, the man says, I'm just really grateful for the Opera-Tuna-Tea <|endoftext|>

Q: A big thank you to Dad jokes. As a professional children's entertainer, finding the dad jokes thread has been a real blessing. I work mainly with children between the ages of four and eight, and, for obvious reasons, I need to keep my jokes clean.

I'm afraid I don't know who started it, but the this paper says otherwise is easily one of my favorites. I took the liberty of having 500 business cards that say otherwise on them. I use them in my performances in a variety of ways. If I see a dad after my show who looks like the type who might enjoy a good pun, I will go up to him and ask him if he thought the show was good. Inevitably he will say yes, and I'll tell him that Unfortunately this card says otherwise. I then leave the dad with the card to use at his own behest. Just wanted to give a big shout out and a big thank you to the Dad jokes community for inspiration.
