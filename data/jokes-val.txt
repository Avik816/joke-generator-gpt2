Q: The best joke my dad ever told My dad is really proud of this one. It's the only joke he's ever told that's been funny enough to make somebody laugh so hard that they spit out of their nose. It was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for this joke, so let me give you some context first: He's been in a motorcycle accident (hit and run by an illegal immigrant), and had to have most of his vertebrae fused. They use titanium rods to hold your back from bending, so as you can imagine its kind of a major operation. His doctor prescribed a year of massage therapy, which he was thankful for. Twice a week he went in to a small clinic for a few hours at a time, and usually had the same masseuse. Let's call her Marge. After four months of therapy they of course got to know each other very well. He was always faithful to my mother, but he was good friends with Marge. Their conversations range all the way from baseball to differentials, and everything stays platonic. Here's where the story begins: During a massage, they are having an energetic conversation, the time comes where he turns onto his back so that she can get to his knee ligaments (chainsawed his kneecap a few years prior, doc said may as well get there too). She goes at it like normal, and the conversation continues. Now here comes the part that made my dad wait to tell me this until recently: The stimulation in his knee for some reason, on that day out of all others, triggered a reflexive erection. There was nothing he could do to stop it. The conversation goes quiet. Marge notices, but doesn't say a word. She remains professional. She continues working. My dad is more embarrassed than he's ever been. Several minutes of silence pass, and my dad cant take it anymore. Marge, he says, I think we need to talk about the elephant in the room. He raises his head to look down the table at her. He glances at it, then back to her A: With a slight shake of his head he says: Wait nevermind, it's only his trunk <|endoftext|>

He chose to play survivor mode, and he came running into the room where we were sitting to brag, MOM, PAPI, I dug a shaft down into this hill and I found TWO DIAMONDS.

Q: Story I told my son. (I did not write this myself but thought it might belong here) "Son, we need to have a chat about Internet Safety. " I slowly crumpled down onto the floor next to him. His laptop was open and he was playing Minecraft on a public server. His eyes were locked into the action. Comments scrolled down the side of the screen in a chat box. "Son, can you stop your game for a minute. " He exited the world, closed the laptop, and looked up at me. Dad, is this going to be another cheesy scary story. Whhaaaat. I faked hurt feelings for a second, and then grinned at him, I thought you liked my cautionary tales. He grew up listening to my stories about children who encountered witches, ghosts, werewolves, and trolls. Like many generations of parents, I used scary stories to reinforce morals and teach lessons about safety. Single dads like me should use all the parenting tools at their disposal. He scrunched his face a little, They were fine when I was six. But now that I'm getting older, they don't scare me anymore. They seem kinda silly. If you are going to tell a story about the Internet, can you make it really, really scary. " I squinted at him incredulously. He folded his arms, "Dad. I'm ten and I can handle it. hmm okay. I'll try. I began, "Once upon a time, there was a boy named Colby. " His expression indicated that he wasn't impressed with the terror of the introduction. He sighed deeply and settled in for one of Dad's cheesy stories. I continued. Colby went online and joined several children's websites. After a while, he started talking to other kids in-game and on the message boards. He made friends with another ten year old boy named Helper23. They liked the same video games and shows. They laughed at each other's jokes. They explored new games together. After several months of friendship, Colby gave Helper23 six diamonds in a game they were playing. This was a very generous gift. Colby's birthday was coming up and Helper23 wanted to send him a cool present in real life. Colby figured it wouldn't hurt to give Helper23 his home address - as long as he promised not to tell it to any strangers or grownups. Helper23 swore he wouldn't tell anyone else, not even his own parents, and set about mailing the package. I paused the story and asked my son, Do you think that was a good idea. " "No. he said shaking his head vigorously. In spite of himself, he was getting into the story. Well neither did Colby. Colby felt guilty about giving away his home address - and his guilt began to grow. And grow. By the time he put on his pajamas the next night, his guilt and fear were larger than anything else in his life. He resolved to admit the truth to his parents. The punishment would be steep, but it was worth it to have a clear conscience. He squirmed in his bed as he waited for his parents to tuck him in. My son knew the scary part was coming up. In spite of his tough talk, he leaned forward wide-eyed. I spoke quietly and deliberately. He heard all the noises of the house. The washing machine bounced around in the laundry room. Branches scraped against the brick outside his room. His baby brother cooed in the nursery. And there were some other noises he couldn't. quite. pinpoint. Finally, his dad's footsteps echoed down the hall. "Hey Dad. " He called out nervously. "I have something to tell you. " His dad stuck his head in the doorway at a weird angle. In the darkness, his mouth didn't seem to move and the eyes were all wrong. Yes, son The voice was way off, too. Are you okay, Dad. The boy asked. Uh-huh sung the father in his strangely affected voice. Colby pulled his covers up defensively. Ummm. Is Mom around. Here I am. Mom's head popped into the doorway below Dad's. Her voice was an unnatural falsetto. Were you about to tell us that you gave our home address to Helper23. You shouldn't have done that. We TOLD you never to give out personal information on the Internet. She continued, He wasn't really a kid. He just pretended to be one. Do you know what he did. He came to our house, broke in, and murdered both of us. Just so he could spend some time with you. A fat man in a wet jacket emerged in the child's doorway holding the two severed heads. Colby shrieked and gasped as the man dropped the heads on the ground, unsheathed his knife, and moved into the room to work on the boy. My son screamed too. He twisted his hands defensively over his face. But we were just getting started with the story. After several hours, the boy was almost dead and his screams had become whimpers. The killer noticed the wailing of a baby in another room and removed his knife from Colby. This was a special treat. He had never murdered a baby before and was excited about the prospect. Helper23 left Colby to die and followed the cries through the house like a homing beacon. In the nursery, he walked to the crib, picked the baby up, and held it in his arms. He moved towards the changing table to get a better look. But as he held the baby, the crying died down. The baby looked up and smiled. Helper23 had never held a baby, but he gently bounced it in his arms like a pro. He wiped his bloody hands on the blanket so he could stroke the baby's cheek, Hey there, sweet little guy. The beautiful rage of sadism melted into something warmer and softer. He walked out of the nursery, took the baby home, named him William, and raised him as his very own. After I finished the story, my son was visibly shaken. Between ragged staccato breaths, he stammered, But Dad, MY name's William. I gave him a classic dad-wink and tousled his hair. Of course it is, son. William ran up the stairs to his bedroom in a fury of sobs. But deep down A: I think he liked the story <|endoftext|>

Problem is, we can't think of any for vanilla. I asked women, and they suggested r/dadjokes as the best pun-makers. So give me all your best Vanilla puns.

Q: Dads, thank you First off, happy Father's Day to all of you out there. My dad likes to joke that it's the least important day of the year and that I'll get it one day. Maybe I will. Until then I want to say thank you. I'm an EMT, my main job is BLS transport. I'm sure most of you dont know what that means but I'm basically a taxi for the elderly/bedridden. A lot of my job is treating/transporting people who have no other means to and from dialysis, dr's appointments, radiation, surgery etc. You can imagine the mentality many of these people have. I'll be honest, I steal your jokes. I screenshot them and reuse them with these patients. So many of them groan and smile and begrudgingly enjoy your jokes. Often they get annoyed because they, should have guessed the answer and wrinkle their brow and spend minutes at the next joke just to hear the answer to, what's blue and isnt very heavy at all . I damn near cracked when someone said, the sky , I mean, that's not wrong, right. These people have everything in the world going against them, but everyone react the same to a good dad joke. Anyway, these jokes all of you have blessed this sub have made a huge impact on not only my life, not only my patients lives, but the way I interact with people in general. So I want to say thank you. You all have made a serious impact on people's lives. A patient who otherwise was borderline mute with others felt comfortable enough after a few of y'alls jokes to tell me she was horribly mistreated at home, she was missing treatments and was on a fast track to her grave. Now, after a few Social Services visits I see her every week at her treatments and shes bright eyed and happier than anyone I know. To all Fathers, Mothers, Brothers Sisters, Sons, Daughters whomever you may be adding to this sub. You all do more than just post jokes A: thank you <|endoftext|>

Q: Dad Joke From One Dad To Another I'm a dad, and I told my dad this, so I think it counts. It got a lot of groans, so I think it's great, if a bit long. --- I once lived near a small, simple town where there lived named Hugh. Hugh was a very smart man stricken with a series of personal tragedies earlier in his life. As a result, he moved to this small town and took a job in his local florist shop, relaxing the days away arranging flowers and trying not to think of times past. Hugh grew to love working there. One day, a disaster struck the town. A small, single engine airplane crashed a block from Hugh's shop, killing those on the plane and setting fire to several buildings, both occupied and empty. The impact ruptured a gas line, which ultimately exploded, creating a shock wave that caused part of the building next to the florist shop to collapse and trap several of Hugh's customers and co-workers inside. The situation was desperate, as the shop would be burned to the ground at any moment. Acting quickly, Hugh located the gas main, shutting it down. Next, Hugh noticed a water storage tank nearby, and opened a release valve that suffocated the fire before it reached his beloved shop. With the fire out, and the florist shop saved along with those trapped inside, Hugh was a hero. The town presented him with a plaque in honor of his courageous deeds. On this plaque was a detailed etching of a bear, and Hugh was touched because he loved bears. But it was the words etched beneath that truly touched him A: Only Hugh could prevent florist fires <|endoftext|>

Q: An amazing dad joke my jazz instructor told the band today. It goes like this: So back in Notre Dame, around the medieval times, the people at the church were looking for someone to ring the bell in the steeple. They started having interviews where each person would ring the bell and they would decide if it sounded good or not. So one guy comes in saying "you know, my method is really odd, but it works. " The church people say "ok then, let's hear it. " The guy walks a few feet back in the steeple and charges head-first towards the bell, he hits it head on and it produces the most beautiful ring ever to be heard. The church people are amazed, they hire him and he goes about every day ringing the bell with his head. However, one day it was decently windy outside and the guy was preparing to ring the bell, and as he was charging a large gust of wind hits him and blows him off the steeple, where he falls to his death.

Q: Researchers for the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority found over 200 dead crows in the Greater Boston area recently. There was concern that they might have died from Avian Flu. An avian pathologist examined the remains of the crows, and to everyone's relief, confirmed the problem was definitely not avian flu. The cause of death was vehicular impacts. However, during the detailed analysis it was noted that varying colours of paints appeared on the birds beaks and claws. By analyzing these paint residues it was determined that nearly 96% of the crows had been struck by trucks, while only 4% were car impacts. The MTA then hired an Ornithological Behavourist to determine the reason for the disproportionate percentages of truck kills vs car kills. He very quickly concluded the cause: When crows eat roadkill, they have a look-out crow nearby to warn of impending danger. They discovered that while all the look-out crows could shout Cah A: , none could shout Truck <|endoftext|>

Q: Three Bulls - A Fable. Three bulls one large, one medium, and one small are out of grass in their pasture. The large bull looks over next to their pasture and sees another pasture with beautiful and lush grass, so he takes a few steps back and charges straight into the fence and breaks it. The large bull started eating. The two smaller bulls come in too and start eating the new grass. Hey. said the large bull, I put in the effort to eat this grass, go find your own. So the medium bull finds another pasture right next to the ones they're in, then he charges at the fence and breaks it and starts eating in that pasture. So the small bull comes in and starts eating. Hey. exclaimed the medium bull, who then continued on to give the same spiel that the large bull gave the two smaller bulls. Then the small bull looks around, but doesn't see any new grass fields. However, he spots a fence that led to a road. So the small bull opens the gate and walks and walks and walks to find that pasture.

Q: A Dad joke planted as a seed, which took 17 years to flower. Not quite as tragic, but it manifested into something which has haunted me at my job for years. When I was a little kid learning about the world around me, my dad was naturally the font of all knowledge for me, He would answer all of little snippersmith's questions with his own unique insights and anecdotes teaching me of my surroundings with varying degrees of accuracy. One day In a picture book, I encountered a photo of one of natures most bizarre creatures, the mighty duck billed platypus. Filled with curiosity of this bizarre creature and an Inability to read a young snippersmith asked his father what this creature was called, To which his father replied, That's a Quackopotamous. As is a highly likely situation in day to day life the Platypus (or indeed the Quackopotamous), did not come into conversation for another 17 years, Until of course the Platypus came into conversation around the lunch table at a now grown up snippersmith's full time place of work. I have not been allowed to forget I thought the Platypus was called a Quackopotamous, Indeed I am reminded on a daily basis by my colleagues, by my nickname Quackopotamous . Thanks Dad.
