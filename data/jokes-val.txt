Q: I was passing by my son's bedroom and was astonished to see the bed was nicely made and everything was picked up Then, I saw an envelope, propped up prominently on the pillow. It was addressed, 'Dad'. With the worst premonition, I opened the envelope and read the letter, with trembling hands: Dear, Dad. It is with great regret and sorrow that I'm writing you. I had to elope with my new girlfriend, because I wanted to avoid a scene with Mom and you. I've been finding real passion with Stacy. She is so nice, but I knew you would not approve of her because of all her piercing's, tattoos, her tight motorcycle clothes and because she is so much older than I am. But it's not only the passion, Dad. She's pregnant. Stacy said that we will be very happy. She owns a trailer in the woods, and has a stack of firewood for the whole winter. We share a dream of having many more children. Stacy has opened my eyes to the fact that marijuana doesn't really hurt anyone. We'll be growing it for ourselves and trading it with the other people in the commune for all the cocaine and ecstasy we want. In the meantime, we'll pray that science will find a cure for AIDS so that Stacy can get better. She sure deserves it. Don't worry Dad, I'm 15, and I know how to take care of myself. Someday, I'm sure we'll be back to visit so you can get to know your many grandchildren. Love, your son, Joshua. P. Dad, none of the above is true. I'm over at Jason's house.

Q: My Favorite Dad Joke There were three medieval kingdoms on the shores of a lake. There was an island in the middle of the lake, over which the kingdoms had been fighting for years. Finally, the three kings decided that they would send their knights out to do battle, and the winner would take the island. The night before the battle, the knights and their squires pitched camp and readied themselves for the fight. The first kingdom had 12 knights, and each knight had five squires, all of whom were busily polishing armor, brushing horses, and cooking food. The second kingdom had twenty knights, and each knight had 10 squires. Everyone at that camp was also busy preparing for battle. At the camp of the third kingdom, there was only one knight, with his squire. This squire took a large pot and hung it from a looped rope in a tall tree. He busied himself preparing the meal, while the knight polished his own armor. When the hour of the battle came, the three kingdoms sent their squires out to fight (this was too trivial a matter for the knights to join in)
A: The battle raged, and when the dust had cleared, the only person left was the lone squire from the third kingdom, having defeated the squires from the other two kingdoms, thus proving that the squire of the high pot and noose is equal to the sum of the squires of the other two sides

Q: Honey Story I hadn't put my own picture up on my dating profile, just a picture of my pickup. But that's okay, because she'd just put a picture of her dog. I sent her a message, something almost-clever like your dog can ride in my pickup any time, and she responded. We clicked pretty quickly, and started chatting regularly. Every day, sometimes throughout the day. Slowly we learned more about each other. Her dog's name was Daisy. My truck's name was Dodge Ram (I apologized for my lack of creativity). She was a CPA. I was a beekeeper. And at this, she stumbled. If we ever meet in real-life, I want you to know that I could never date a beekeeper. But we were still far away from that point, so it was moot. But time went on, and we gradually became closer to that point. More personal information. What firm she worked for. Where my farm was. Names of relatives. Names of high schools. All the things that just come up in conversation eventually if you talk to someone long enough. But, oddly, after all this time, neither of us had thought to send any pictures. Until one day I got a message from her: I never thought I'd say this, but I really do want to meet you in person. I think we have a rare connection, and I don't want to squander it. I want to send you my picture, and I want you to send me yours, but I'm telling you, I can never date a beekeeper. I couldn't imagine a life without my bees. But I also couldn't imagine a life without her. Tentatively, reluctantly, I clicked on the image attached to her message. Then I saw her face
A: Now I'm a bee leaver

Q: Groundhog Day Not completely sure this is a dadjoke but it sure got the same reaction. This happened about two years ago. My wife used to work nights and on Friday and Saturday after she went to work, my then-12yo son and I would often watch a movie together. Sometimes he picked, usually it was a movie from The List, movies I liked when I was his age, things that shaped my sense of humor. I want him to be able to recognize the stupid quotes and references I throw at him. It's his cultural education. So we settled in for Groundhog Day. I'm a sucker for time travel shenanigans. Finished it up, he enjoyed it, and the next morning he was off to Boy Scout camp for a week. He came back, we're all excited to see him, and I tell him I got Groundhog Day 2 from Netflix. Threw it in the DVD player and we got about 20 minutes into before he looked at me and said "this is just Groundhog Day all over again, isn't it. There is no Groundhog Day 2

Q: Story I told my son. (I did not write this myself but thought it might belong here) "Son, we need to have a chat about Internet Safety. " I slowly crumpled down onto the floor next to him. His laptop was open and he was playing Minecraft on a public server. His eyes were locked into the action. Comments scrolled down the side of the screen in a chat box. "Son, can you stop your game for a minute. " He exited the world, closed the laptop, and looked up at me. Dad, is this going to be another cheesy scary story. Whhaaaat. I faked hurt feelings for a second, and then grinned at him, I thought you liked my cautionary tales. He grew up listening to my stories about children who encountered witches, ghosts, werewolves, and trolls. Like many generations of parents, I used scary stories to reinforce morals and teach lessons about safety. Single dads like me should use all the parenting tools at their disposal. He scrunched his face a little, They were fine when I was six. But now that I'm getting older, they don't scare me anymore. They seem kinda silly. If you are going to tell a story about the Internet, can you make it really, really scary. " I squinted at him incredulously. He folded his arms, "Dad. I'm ten and I can handle it. hmm okay. I'll try. I began, "Once upon a time, there was a boy named Colby. " His expression indicated that he wasn't impressed with the terror of the introduction. He sighed deeply and settled in for one of Dad's cheesy stories. I continued. Colby went online and joined several children's websites. After a while, he started talking to other kids in-game and on the message boards. He made friends with another ten year old boy named Helper23. They liked the same video games and shows. They laughed at each other's jokes. They explored new games together. After several months of friendship, Colby gave Helper23 six diamonds in a game they were playing. This was a very generous gift. Colby's birthday was coming up and Helper23 wanted to send him a cool present in real life. Colby figured it wouldn't hurt to give Helper23 his home address - as long as he promised not to tell it to any strangers or grownups. Helper23 swore he wouldn't tell anyone else, not even his own parents, and set about mailing the package. I paused the story and asked my son, Do you think that was a good idea. " "No. he said shaking his head vigorously. In spite of himself, he was getting into the story. Well neither did Colby. Colby felt guilty about giving away his home address - and his guilt began to grow. And grow. By the time he put on his pajamas the next night, his guilt and fear were larger than anything else in his life. He resolved to admit the truth to his parents. The punishment would be steep, but it was worth it to have a clear conscience. He squirmed in his bed as he waited for his parents to tuck him in. My son knew the scary part was coming up. In spite of his tough talk, he leaned forward wide-eyed. I spoke quietly and deliberately. He heard all the noises of the house. The washing machine bounced around in the laundry room. Branches scraped against the brick outside his room. His baby brother cooed in the nursery. And there were some other noises he couldn't. quite. pinpoint. Finally, his dad's footsteps echoed down the hall. "Hey Dad. " He called out nervously. "I have something to tell you. " His dad stuck his head in the doorway at a weird angle. In the darkness, his mouth didn't seem to move and the eyes were all wrong. Yes, son The voice was way off, too. Are you okay, Dad. The boy asked. Uh-huh sung the father in his strangely affected voice. Colby pulled his covers up defensively. Ummm. Is Mom around. Here I am. Mom's head popped into the doorway below Dad's. Her voice was an unnatural falsetto. Were you about to tell us that you gave our home address to Helper23. You shouldn't have done that. We TOLD you never to give out personal information on the Internet. She continued, He wasn't really a kid. He just pretended to be one. Do you know what he did. He came to our house, broke in, and murdered both of us. Just so he could spend some time with you. A fat man in a wet jacket emerged in the child's doorway holding the two severed heads. Colby shrieked and gasped as the man dropped the heads on the ground, unsheathed his knife, and moved into the room to work on the boy. My son screamed too. He twisted his hands defensively over his face. But we were just getting started with the story. After several hours, the boy was almost dead and his screams had become whimpers. The killer noticed the wailing of a baby in another room and removed his knife from Colby. This was a special treat. He had never murdered a baby before and was excited about the prospect. Helper23 left Colby to die and followed the cries through the house like a homing beacon. In the nursery, he walked to the crib, picked the baby up, and held it in his arms. He moved towards the changing table to get a better look. But as he held the baby, the crying died down. The baby looked up and smiled. Helper23 had never held a baby, but he gently bounced it in his arms like a pro. He wiped his bloody hands on the blanket so he could stroke the baby's cheek, Hey there, sweet little guy. The beautiful rage of sadism melted into something warmer and softer. He walked out of the nursery, took the baby home, named him William, and raised him as his very own. After I finished the story, my son was visibly shaken. Between ragged staccato breaths, he stammered, But Dad, MY name's William. I gave him a classic dad-wink and tousled his hair. Of course it is, son. William ran up the stairs to his bedroom in a fury of sobs. But deep down
A: I think he liked the story

Q: A coworker wasted my time with this joke today. There were three kingdoms, each bordering on the same lake. For centuries, these kingdoms had fought over an island in the middle of that lake. One day, they decided to have it out, once and for all. The first kingdom was quite rich, and sent an army of 25 knights, each with three squires. The night before the battle, the knights jousted and cavorted as their squires polished armor, cooked food, and sharpened weapons. The second kingdom was not so wealthy, and sent only 10 knights, each with 2 squires. The night before the battle, the knights cavorted and sharpened their weapons as the squires polished armor and prepared dinner. The third kingdom was very poor, and only sent one elderly knight with his sole squire. The night before the battle, the knight sharpened his weapon, while the squire, using a looped rope, slung a pot high over the fire to cook while he prepared the knight's armor. The next day, the battle began. All the knights of the first two kingdoms had cavorted a bit too much (one should never cavort while sharpening weapons and jousting) and could not fight. The squire of the third kingdom could not rouse the elderly knight in time for combat. So, in the absence of the knights, the squires fought. The battle raged well into the late hours, but when the dust finally settled, a solitary figure limped from the carnage. The lone squire from the third kingdom dragged himself away, beaten, bloodied, but victorious
A: And it just goes to prove, the squire of the high pot and noose is equal to the sum of the squires of the other two sides

Q: How I quit my school newsreader job When I was in high school the media department got a few of us to do a weekly news update and I was co-anchor. On our last day of filming for the year we decided to go out for pizza and at the end of the night it was just me and Jessica, the main anchor on the show. I walked her home and just as we got to the bridge near her house I tripped on the uneven pavement and bumped her. She fell over the rail and hit her head on the large stones by the creek bank. I didn't know what to do and panicked. I felt that my whole life would be over if everyone found out that I killed Jessica. So, in that moment, I knew what I had to do. Nobody saw us leave together and no-one passed us on the road. I went down to where her warm lifeless body laid and dug a shallow grave. The ground was soft, so it was easy to make one big enough for Jessica's frail but broken body. She seemed so peaceful in that moment under the bridge and you could almost mistake her for being asleep under the warm sodium lights above. I tossed her in making sure that everything was covered and wouldn't be exposed any time soon. I took a nearby branch and used it to brush over my tracks and made my way back up to the road. I waited until there were no signs of anyone else and hurried back home making sure to discard my shoes in an industrial bin on the way. I made sure to leave behind anything with any possible traces of dirt or residue that forensics could possibly link back to me. After I had a shower, I cleared the fog on the glass and caught a glimpse of my reflection in the mirror. I was not the same person that I was a few hours ago and I knew that I could never be that person ever again. The days and weeks that followed were not easy for me. I could not feel any emotion at all: the closest thing being anger that I did not feel guilty at all. Not then anyway. It started with the nightmares where I would be under that bridge hearing Jessica calling out to me asking why - why. - until I would wake up in sweaty sheets gasping for breath. The nightmares got worse, but also the weight of it all. In the weeks that followed, the community rallied together and there were posters of Jessica's smiling face everywhere. I could not think about anything else and everything else didn't really matter. I made it through each day by playing a version of myself: like I was controlling some sort of puppet and going through the motions. The show continued, until one day - and I remember the moment. The emotion I had been suppressing all along could not be contained any more. We were filming, and it was maybe 3 or even 4 months since the night I did what I did. I was ready to do my segment on the upcoming home game when I saw something caught in the spiral of my notebook - it was a single strand of Jessica's hair. I could not speak and when I looked up everyone was staring at me and, at first, I didn't know why. I only realised that I was crying hysterically when I saw the monitor. I felt that black darkness that had enshrouded me for so long getting tighter, like a carpet snake trying to maintain its grip on prey, but I knew I had to tell everyone. I began speaking, describing the events that happened and the way her neck was bent all the way back and the way her body was still warm when I touched her. The way I brushed away her hair from her cheek when I held her. The way her skin looked under the warmth of sodium lights. I told everyone how I felt when I realised what I had done, and how I came to the decision I made that night. The snake slowly hissed, and I could feel its grip loosening its hold on me as I told her story. I felt, for the first time in a long time, that I could breathe. Breathe. In that instant I felt a release, a perverted type of redemption that at the very least allowed Jessica to have some sort of peace. I knew that I had to tell everyone about that night and what happened to her. If not for me then at least for her. I had to talk
A: talk about burying the lead

Q: The Coffin Joke Three brothers are trick or treating near a shady house. Suddenly, a spider appears on the first brothers arm causing him to scream in shock. This causes the second brother to run away in fear only to get hit over the head by a dead tree branch. The third brother tries to escape but trips over a coffin. Filled with fright, the three brothers decide to go back home before they are stopped by a ghost that informs them, "The items you have encountered today will kill you in exactly 20 years. " and vanishes into thin air. Understandably, the three brothers were terrified out of their wits and ran back to their house. 20 years later on Halloween, the first brother has booby trapped and spider-proofed his entire house. Unfortunately, he accidently runs into a wall causing a black widow to fall on his arm and killing him. The second brother has prepared for many years and made sure that he was nowhere near any trees. However, he somehow miscalculated by one day and was killed when a lightning bolt struck a tree causing it to fall and crush him. The third brother completely forgot about the ghost's warning and was having dinner with his wife. His allergies were really acting up that night, so he decided to go to a pharmacy to purchase some allergy medicine. Suddenly, without any warning, the entire store goes dark and a giant coffin appears in front of him, opens up, and starts moving towards him. Remembering his frightful Halloween over 20 years ago, the brother starts desperately throwing everything in sight towards the coffin but to no avail. Now there is nothing else left other than a lone bottle of NyQuil. In one last brave attempt, the brother throws the bottle of NyQuil at the coffin and it miraculously vanishes
A: Because NyQuil keeps the coffin' away

Q: Dad just emailed me this article about a crow problem in Boston CROW KILLS Researchers for the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority found over 200 dead crows near greater Boston recently, and there was concern that they may have died from Avian Flu. A Bird Pathologist examined the remains of all the crows, and, to everyone's relief, confirmed the problem was definitely NOT Avian Flu. The cause of death appeared to be vehicular impacts. However, during the detailed analysis it was noted that varying colors of paints appeared on the bird's beaks and claws. By analyzing these paint residues it was determined that 98% of the crows had been killed by impact with trucks, while only 2% were killed by an impact with a car. MTA then hired an Ornithological Behaviorist to determine if there was a cause for the disproportionate percentages of truck kills versus car kills. The Ornithological Behaviorist very quickly concluded the cause: when crows eat road kill, they always have a look-out crow in a nearby tree to warn of impending danger. They discovered that while all the lookout crows could shout Cah , not a single one could shout Truck

A few hours later, after all was arranged and the tree was ready to go, my mum wanted my dad to turn the lights on, to truly signify Christmas had begun. Instead of just flicking the switch, he asked all of us to raise our hands in the air.

Q: A long one So, a few weeks ago, someone posted a pretty long dad joke. Here's mine--it's what my dad would call a Shaggy dog story . The dolphin trainers at the zoo were very upset because the dolphins were very ill and getting worse. An animal shaman told them that he could not only cure the dolphins, but make them live forever--all he needed were some young sea gulls. The trainers immediately set off to find some young sea gulls. While looking for the gulls, a lion at the zoo escaped. The trainers didn't care--they had to save the dolphins. They found their gulls and were making there way back to the dolphin enclosure when they came across the lion. Fortunately, it was dead asleep, having been hit with a tranquilizer dart--but it was right in the middle of the path. So, they carefully stepped across it, and were immediately arrested. The crime
A: Transporting young gulls across state lions for immortal porpoises
